<p class = "dashed center", style = "color: rgb(4,234,4); width: 50%; margin: 0 auto; text-shadow: 6px 6px 6px #000000; "> So here's a short introduction / synopsis or whatever ! I wasn't really <i> alive </i> back when people on the internet had their own websites where they had complete freedom to indulge in whatever gobbledygook they wanted, 
  but I feel like that notion is really fun and interesting. A creative space to upload whatever you want, or decorate as you please without being limited by what meager customization options exist on social media today ! It's like a really novel idea, 
  and I'd like to give it a shot even if I don't know much about how websites work. Whatever the case, I'm gonna try my best to have fun with this ! I'll try and upload my toys and knick-knacks or projects and whatnot onto here.    </p>
